				<h2>Girl at War</h2>
				<p>“The war in Zagreb began over a pack of cigarettes,” the 10-year-old narrator tells us. In the first of the novel’s four parts, tomboy Ana describes what made her world precious (parents and baby sister, her best friend Luka), and how that world collapsed in just a few months. Disintegration begins with a cancelled holiday because of road blockades; then the newsagent’s dark question about cigarettes, “Serbian or Croatian?”; the missing kid at school; the first refugees from out of town, and the appalling whispered details (one man’s wife was taken by a paramilitary with a necklace of human ears). Nović follows the lurch into total nightmare all the way to the event that terminates the first section, and Ana’s childhood. This is tough territory for any novelist, and it takes guts to go there. This key scene is written with chilling restraint: in the unspeakable moment, that crisp voice is devastating.
          The young perspective is the novel’s principal charm, but the tone is disrupted with too many overstretched exchanges anxious to tell us things we already know. This may be a problem of balancing the emotional pitch between the solemn adult and the fresh child-narrator. But when it works, it’s terrific: “As a side effect of modern warfare, we had the peculiar privilege of watching the destruction of our country on television.” In a childish war game, “Those who died with their limbs bent in unnatural angles and could hold their positions the longest were the winners.” At her best Nović is a poet: “Summer gave way to fall in the abrupt, unbeautiful way Zagreb always changed its seasons”; and later, at university in the US, Ana’s sympathetic professor “seemed to know I was not at home in the world”. I longed for more of these perceptive asides, a sensitivity to language that is particularly striking if you read Nović’s fascinating reflections on what it’s like to be a deaf author.
